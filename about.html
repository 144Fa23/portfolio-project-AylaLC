            <h2>General Interests</h2>

            <p>Like other educators, I have hobbies outside of the world of education too. For instance:</p>
            <UL>
                <li>I love to read. I nearly always have a book with me!</li>
                <li>I enjoy cooking. Homemade chicken noodle soup is my specialty.</li>
                <li>When I have free time, I like to spend time with my family!</li>
