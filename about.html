        <h1>Get To Know Me!</h1>
            
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My name is Ayla Campbell, and I am originally from a small town called Colfax, Iowa.  After I graduated from Colfax-Mingo High School in 2021, I enrolled into Northwest Missouri State University to study Business Education.</p>
        
            
        <h3>College Accomplishments</h3>

            <li>Pi Omega Pi Business Honors Program</li>
            <li>Awared the McIntosh Hall Scholarship</li>
            <li>Voluntered at the Lettuce Dream Greenhouse</li>
            </UL>
