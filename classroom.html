        <h2>My Classroom Management Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The keys to maintaining a well-managed classroom is building realtionships with students and increasing student engagement. As an educator, I will build relationships with my students by getting to know them. I will listen to stories about their lives, ask them questions about their interests, and actively observing their actions in the classroom. After I get to know my students, I will try to find ways to incorporate their interests into my lessons. That way, my students will be actively engaged in each lesson.</p>

        <h2>Non-negotiables</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Respect everyone in the classroom! This includes the teacher, your peers, and yourself.</li>
            <li>Come to class prepared with the proper materials. (A charged Chromebook, a pen/pencil, a notebook, and your textbook)</li>
            <li>Before class begins, place your silenced cellphone into your backpack or face down on your desk.</li>
            <li>Respect classroom materials by handling them gently, and replacing them to their correct position after use.</li>
            <li>Work hard and remember to try your best!</li>

        </ul>

            <h2>Classroom procedures and expecations</h2>


            <h3>Procedures for entering the classroom</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrive on time before the bell rings</li>
                <li>Come into class with a postive attitude</li>
                <li>Walk to your seat calmly and quietly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Procedures for preparing for class to begin</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Retrieve any materials needed out of your backpack</li>
                <li>Place your silenced cellphone into your backpack or face down on your desk</li>
                <li>Observe the lesson objectives on the board</li>
                <li>Complete your bell ringer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Procedures during the lesson</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Raise your hand if you have a question!</li>
                <li>Respect the teacher by listening quietly as she speaks</li>
                <li>Use class time wisely</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Procedures for classroom dismissal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin putting your materials away when the teacher announces that the end of class is approaching</li>
                <li>Return any classroom materials that are out of place</li>
                <li>Clean up your area</li>
                <li>Remain in your seat until the bell rings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Logical Consequences</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, students do not always follow the rules. When this occurs, I believe that it is important for them to receive logical consequences. That way, they come to understand how to appropriately behave and why their actions were wrong. As an educator, I will never discipline a student with the intention of revenge. Instead, my goal will be to help my students learn appropriate behaviors.
