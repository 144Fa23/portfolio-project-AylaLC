        <p>Welcome to my teaching portfolio! My name is Ayla Campbell, and I am a future educator with a passion to teach secondary business education.</p>

        <p>As a teacher, I hope to inspire my students and provide them with the tools that will help them create better futures for themselves.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I intend to use my classroom as a safe space that will help my students grow as learners and as a people.</p>
